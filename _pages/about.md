I am an Phd student in the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University, advised by Prof. [Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics from Wuhan University in 2021.

My interest spans multiple areas, generative modeling, representation learning, and learning theory. More recently, I am studying the sample complexity and applications to other fields of diffusion based generative models.
